# vECU-AI Framework

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an early-stage, exploratory project. Features and structure may evolve significantly.

### üß© About

This project aims to create a **controller-agnostic virtual ECU framework** that enables real-time testing of AI models under simulated hardware conditions. It‚Äôs designed to plug into platforms like **Renode**, **ROS2**, and **CARLA**, supporting modular communication with AI inference engines.

It is **hardware-agnostic**, **AI-model-agnostic**, and focuses on keeping components loosely coupled for flexibility.

### üèóÔ∏è Core Components

| Component    | Role                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `firmware/`  | Generic HAL-based firmware for vECU           |
| `hal/`       | HAL shims, including Renode-specific adapters |
| `ai_engine/` | AI models or inference APIs (via gRPC/Flask)  |
| `bridge/`    | UART, CAN, TCP bridges between AI ‚Üî vECU      |
| `sim_world/` | CARLA + ROS2 scenes, sensor data sources      |
| `github/`    | CI/CD, workflow automation, Docker setup      |

### üîÑ Workflow Overview

1. **CARLA + ROS2** simulate sensor inputs
2. **Sensor data flows to the vECU** (running in Renode)
3. vECU communicates with **AI inference service** over UART/TCP
4. **AI model infers** and responds with control commands
5. Firmware processes them ‚Üí feeds back into simulation loop

### üì¶ Goals

* [x] Platform-agnostic firmware abstraction
* [x] Renode support via `.repl` and `.resc` scripting
* [x] Basic AI ‚Üî vECU communication bridge
* [ ] Real sensor simulation loop (FMU + Carla + ROS2)
* [ ] Scalable CI/CD pipeline for AI + firmware
